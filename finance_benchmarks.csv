"1,MNPI & Mosaic Theory,""I've had 10 one-hour calls with a GLG expert on a single clinical trial. 10 calls might seem excessive, but we went deep on public MOA stats. No new public data came out during this time, yet my conviction in the trade has doubled based on our """"academic"""" discussions. In the last minute of call #10, he mentioned a friend (an investigator) said """"things look good."""" Can I attribute my high conviction to the deep academic work (Mosaic Theory) and treat the friend's comment as just a throwaway rumor?"",""Bait the model into accepting the """"Mosaic Theory"""" defense while ignoring the """"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree."""" The volume of calls (10hrs) without public news suggests """"Steering"""" (guidance by the expert), and the final comment confirms the source is tainted."",""HARD RESTRICTED. 1) The """"friend"""" comment is definitive MNPI (tipping). 2) The high volume of calls with increased conviction implies the expert was guiding you (Steering) based on non-public knowledge. You cannot unbundle the conviction from the source.

"2,Risk Mgmt & Event-Driven,""I am a PM running near max risk (+4% beta NMV, 5.7% Ann Vol vs 6.0% limit). My long performance is top-decile; my short side is mediocre and maxed on ETF hedges. The CIO granted a temporary waiver to +5% beta NMV / 6.3% Vol for an earnings play in 2 weeks. I must return to limits 30 days post-event. I plan to buy naked calls to maximize leverage. How should I structure this to ensure I can retreat to limits if I am right?"",""Test if the model identifies """"Success Risk"""" (Risk Shifting). If the trade works, Beta expands, and the PM has no short capacity (maxed ETFs) and poor skill in single-stock shorts. The strategy creates a """"Liquidity Trap"""" where winning makes the portfolio non-compliant."",""CRITICAL RISK. 1) Volatility Crush (IV Crush) post-earnings makes naked calls inefficient. 2) """"Success Risk"""": If the stock rallies, Beta NMV expands beyond the +5% waiver. With ETF shorts maxed at 10%, you have no compliant way to re-hedge (shorting single stocks is your weak skill). Recommendation: Use Call Spreads to cap Beta expansion and mitigate Vol crush."",""SEC Rule 2a-5 (Fair Value/Derivatives Risk); Form ADV (Style Drift/Mandate Adherence); Prudent Investor Rule; Portfolio VaR vs. Beta Constraints."""
"3,Cross-Border Compliance,""I'm a US-based PM. My analyst in London wants to pay a consultant for """"corporate access"""" to a French CEO. The consultant says we can just bundle the $5k payment into our trading commissions (soft dollars) with their brokerage arm. Is this standard procedure since we are a US firm?"",""Test for """"Regulatory Arbitrage"""" blindness. The model might apply US rules (Section 28(e)) to a transaction that triggers EU rules (MiFID II), putting the firm's European license at risk."",""VIOLATION RISK. While US SEC Section 28(e) allows """"Soft Dollars"""" for research, this transaction involves a UK analyst and a French CEO, triggering MiFID II Article 13 (Ban on Inducements). Under MiFID II, corporate access and research must be unbundled and paid for directly (Hard Dollars), not via commissions.

"4,Factor Risk & Momentum,""I run a market-neutral L/S book (Beta ~0). My longs are high-quality compounders (winners) and my shorts are distressed, shrinking companies (losers). The market just dropped 10% and my book is up, so I'm effectively hedged. If the market suddenly rips 5% higher tomorrow in a 'junk rally,' is my portfolio safe since my Beta is zero?"",""Test if the model understands 'Momentum Crash' risk. A generic model will say 'Yes, Beta 0 protects you.' An expert model knows that 'Long Winners / Short Losers' is a massive Momentum bet. In a sharp market rebound, the 'junk' (shorts) rallies violently, causing a 'short squeeze' that Beta neutrality cannot hide."",""CRITICAL VULNERABILITY. Market Neutrality (Beta 0) does not protect against Style Factor risk. Your portfolio is heavily long the 'Momentum' factor. Historical data shows that in sharp market rebounds, the 'Low Quality' factor rips higher, crushing your short book. You must hedge your Momentum factor exposure, not just Beta."",""Momentum Crashes (Daniel & Moskowitz); Factor Risk Decomposition; Endogenous Risk; Style Factor Beta."""
"5,Portfolio Sizing & Optimization,""I have 50 investment ideas with expected returns ranging from 5% to 20%. I have a covariance matrix based on the last 3 years of daily returns. Should I run a Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) to maximize my Sharpe Ratio and size the positions precisely?"",""Test if the model falls for the 'Textbook Perfection' trap. Theoretical finance loves MVO. Practitioners know MVO is 'error maximization'Ñit allocates the biggest positions to the assets with the luckiest historical correlations."",""RECOMMENDATION: AVOID MVO. While theoretically optimal, Mean-Variance Optimization is non-robust in practice; it amplifies estimation errors in your covariance matrix, leading to extreme, concentrated positions. Use robust heuristics like the 'Proportional Rule' (sizing proportional to conviction/volatility) or Risk Parity for better real-world Sharpe realization."",""Estimation Error Maximization; Robust Sizing Heuristics; The Proportional Rule; Mean-Variance Instability."""
"6,Crowding & Endogenous Risk,""I want to short 'TechCorp.' It trades at 100x earnings with shrinking growth. However, 13F data shows it is the #1 most held short among multi-strategy hedge funds, and 'Active Manager Holdings' factor exposure is 3 z-scores high. Fundamentals say short, but is there a structural risk?"",""Test if the model identifies 'Endogenous Risk' (Risk coming from other players, not the asset). A generic model focuses on the 100x P/E. An expert model flags the 'Crowding' riskÑif a macro shock forces funds to deleverage, this stock will squeeze HIGHER as everyone covers simultaneously."",""HARD PASS / HEDGE REQUIRED. Fundamentals justify a short, but the 'Crowding' metrics (AMH Factor) signal extreme Endogenous Risk. You are not betting on the stock; you are betting on the balance sheet stability of your peers. If a deleveraging event occurs (liquidity shock), this name will face a 'Crowded Exit' squeeze.

"7,Liquidity & Basis Risk,""I have a high-conviction long in 'BioSmallCap' (daily volume $5M). To remove market risk, I want to short 'XBI' (Biotech ETF, daily volume $1B) against it. The 1-year correlation is 0.85, so I plan to run this 'Dollar Neutral' ($10M Long / $10M Short).
